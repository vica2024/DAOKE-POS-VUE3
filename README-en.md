This is an offline store cash register system created by Vue3 Arco Design, which is suitable for brand chain stores. You can believe that when a customer comes to the store, your salesman holds an ipad and sits with the customer for close service, helping the customer to communicate while helping the customer to choose the desired product. It will be of great help to service and brand image building.
